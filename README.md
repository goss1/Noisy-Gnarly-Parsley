# Noisy-Gnarly-Parsley
Experimental vector-based animation software in Processing

This is an early look at a drawing/animation workspace built in Processing, and using the ControlP5 UI library. Currently, it is a sort of functional drawing tool (with a small peek into its animation potential if you can find your way to a shape's noise menu). In the next year, I hope to have a modular workflow built that allows for expansion in whatever direction my animation curiousity takes me.
